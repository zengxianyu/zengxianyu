### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**zengxianyu/zengxianyu** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on phd
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on computer vision
- âš¡ Fun fact: i might have been named zengxianyu if i were a boy according to our family naming traditions
